# MLFM
# Project of Multi-scale low-frequency Memory Network(MLFM)

This is the code for Multiscale Low-Frequency Memory Network

Our paper is proposing a a multiscale low-frequency memory (MLFM) network, which could effectively provide low-frequency information storage to popular networks. We will test the effect of our Low-Frequency Memory Unit (LFMU) in different networks. So, we will make direct improvements in the original code of several popular networks, which can be seen:

# ResNet
The foundational code for our project is derived from the repository "pytorch_image_classification" by hysts. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own LFUM unit, resulting in the creation of the MLFM_ResNet network.

# SeNet
The foundational code for this project is derived from the repository "SENet-PyTorch" by Kaifeng Wei. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own LFUM unit, resulting in the creation of the MLFM_SENet network.

# MobileNetV2
The foundational code for our project is derived from the repository "mobilenetv2.pytorch" by Duo Li. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own LFUM unit, resulting in the creation of the MLFM_MobileNet network.

# ConvNeXt
The foundational code for our project is derived from the repository "inceptionnext" by Sea AI Lab. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own LFUM unit, resulting in the creation of the MLFM_ConvNeXt network. (In this repository, ConvNeXt is also implemented at the same time as InceptionNeXt.)

# inceptionnext
The foundational code for our project is derived from the repository "inceptionnext" by Sea AI Lab. We appreciate their contribution to the open-source community. Our adaptation involves the integration of our own LFUM unit, resulting in the creation of the MLFM_InceptionNeXt network.
